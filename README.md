### Tagline
An exclusive, tailored sushi experience

### What and why?
MERN Stack, becuase it allows for fast, efficient scability as more users and sushi spots get added to the site.

### For whom?
Sushi lovers and afficiandos, such as ourselves. They dont need to be tech-savvy.

### How?
This service will be exclusive to only the most avid sushi enthusiasts, screened by questionaire to verify their level of expertise and commitment to sushi.

More importantly, users will be able to discover new sushi spots and share their own finds with others. 

This means that on the home page, new reviews / most popular reviews of spots nearby will be shown on a live feed, while another other tab will be present for accessing your own profile / reviews / friends. The second tab will enable users to search and discover new spots, which you can sort by popularity, value, and overall review (which can be broken down into subcategories such as fish quality, rice quality, etc.)

### Scope
This is managable because we can choose which features are essential for deployment, while others can be slimmed down to maintaining overall functionality.

Additionally, new features will be implemented through the Agile framework. 

## Submission
Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The message should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private Slack assignments channel AND in the public #project-ideas channel.  In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.

## What happens next

We will select a subset of the proposals that we think will be the most interesting and appropriate for this course. These will be published to the class. Your next assignment will be to rank your favorites. We will then make team assignments based on this information and the answers you have provided to the previous introductory questionnaire. 

If your proposal is selected, you are 99% guaranteed to be part of that team.
